# Scaling Up the Infrastructure

## User Access Flow
- The user enters www.foobar.com in their browser.
- The DNS query returns the IP address of the load balancer.
- The user's browser establishes a connection with the load balancer.
- The load balancer (HAproxy), configured as part of a cluster, distributes incoming requests among multiple web servers.
- The web server (Nginx) handles static content requests and, if necessary, forwards them to the application server for dynamic content processing.
- The application server interacts with the MySQL database to query or modify the required data.
- The results are sent back to the web server, which sends the final response to the user through the load balancer.

# Infrastructure Components

## Servers (4 Servers)
- The infrastructure now includes an additional server, allowing the system components to be split across different servers for optimized performance. This includes:

- Web server (Nginx)
- Application server
- Database server (MySQL)
- New server to add capacity

## Load Balancer (HAproxy, Cluster)
- The load balancer is configured as part of a cluster with a second load balancer to better handle traffic and distribute requests among available servers. This increases redundancy and ensures higher availability.

## Web Server (Nginx)
- The web server handles static files (such as images, stylesheets, etc.) and acts as an intermediary for requests requiring dynamic processing, which are sent to the application server.

## Application Server
- The application server processes the application's logic, manages user interactions, and communicates with the database to perform read and write operations.

## Database (MySQL)
- The database server stores the website's information, managing the read and write requests from the application server.

# Explanation of Each Added Element

## New Server
- An additional server is added to facilitate the separation of components (web server, application server, and database), improving the overall system performance by reducing resource competition.

## Load Balancer Cluster (HAproxy)
- By configuring the load balancers in a cluster, redundancy is increased, and the capacity to handle more incoming traffic is improved. If one load balancer fails, the other can continue functioning, ensuring higher availability.

## Separation of Components
- Dividing components across different servers optimizes performance. For example, the application server does not compete for resources with the database server, reducing latency and improving response times.

# Potential Issues with This Infrastructure

## Single Point of Failure
- Although more servers and load balancers have been added, it is crucial to constantly monitor the load balancers to avoid relying on a single critical layer.

## Lack of Monitoring and Additional Security
- This configuration lacks monitoring tools, firewalls, or encrypted traffic (HTTPS). Adding these elements would be essential for a robust and secure infrastructure.

## Load Balancing
- While the load balancer cluster improves traffic distribution, it would be advisable to review the algorithm being used (e.g., "round-robin" or "least connections") to ensure traffic is distributed evenly.
