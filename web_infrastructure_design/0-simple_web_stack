# Simple Web Infrastructure

## User Access Flow

- The user enters www.foobar.com in their browser's address bar.
- The user's computer sends a DNS query to obtain the IP address associated with www.foobar.com.
- The DNS server responds with the IP address 8.8.8.8, which is linked to www.foobar.com.
- The user's browser makes an HTTP request to IP 8.8.8.8.
- The web server (Nginx) on the server receives the request.
- Nginx processes the request and, if necessary, forwards it to the application server.
- The application server executes the necessary operations and may interact with the MySQL database.
- The server returns an HTTP response to the user's browser.
- The browser displays the received web page to the user.

## Infrastructure Components

## Server (IP: 8.8.8.8)
- A server is a computer system that offers resources, services, or applications to other devices, known as clients. In this case, the server hosts all the components of the website.

## Domain Name (foobar.com)
- The domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites. The www record in www.foobar.com is typically a CNAME record that points to the domain’s A record, which contains the server’s IP address.

## Web Server (Nginx)
- The web server is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. It serves static files and acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding dynamic content requests to the application server.

## Application Server
- The application server executes the website’s business logic, processes dynamic requests, and manages interactions with the database.

## Application Files
- These are the files that contain the web application’s code, which can be written in languages like PHP, Python, or any other.

## Database (MySQL)
- The database is responsible for storing and managing the website’s data, such as user information, content, transactions, and more.

## Communication Protocol
- The server communicates with the user’s computer via the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which allows the transmission of web data.

# Issues with This Infrastructure

## Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
- All components are concentrated on a single server. If the server fails, the website will become unavailable.

## Maintenance Downtime
- If the server needs to be restarted for maintenance or updates (such as deploying new code), the website will become temporarily inaccessible.

## Limited Scalability
- This infrastructure cannot handle a high volume of traffic since there is no load balancing system or multiple servers to distribute the demand.
